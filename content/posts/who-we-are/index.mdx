Hi everyone! We're Kimi and Rahul — amateur runners, young professionals in San Francisco, coffee and food enthusiasts, Golden Bears.

I (Kimi) love all things food and fitness. Whether it be hunting down the newest third wave coffee shops that carry Oatly, drawing arrow-pushing mechanisms that describe food science, or going on tangents about low FODMAP foods and cruciferous vegetables, I'm yo gal. I also enjoy dragging my boo (see below) out of bed before the crack of dawn (aka the peak of his irritability) for some morning miles! Catch me running the streets of SF every morning.

I (Rahul) enjoy engineering software! I love making great things, whether it be web applications or coffee. My thoughts behind creating this blog were to (1) be able to write about things I care about — coffee & exercise, (2) create a beautiful medium — this blog — through which to divulge entertaining and informational resources, (3) develop a wholesome and quality hobby with my boo (see above), and (4) have fun (!) — I tend to put a lot of pressure on myself, so I want this to be a way to unwind and just be me. :)

Aside from the reasons above, we think a uniquely great thing about our blog is that *we'll be growing with you*. We're not world-star baristas who've been drinking quality coffee all our lives and have strong opinions.

We are regular Joes (as in cups of coffee) who have a bit of extra money and time that we want to start something new! We both enjoy our fair share of hipster and mainstream coffee shops, but this is now a challenge!

Along our way, we'll try to provide you with the answers to the questions we have ourselves, provide educational nutritional material and commentary, refine our coffee tastes, and make many bad puns (this is Kimi's wheelhouse).

We're excited to have you with us!
